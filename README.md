# Parkinson-s-Disease
The dataset is annotated with three classes: med off (Parkinson’s patients off medication), med on (Parkinson’s patients on medication), and healthy controls (non-Parkinsonian individuals).
This project is a data-driven study aimed at analyzing distinct motor conditions observed in individuals diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. The dataset includes three primary labels:

Med off: Individuals diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease who have not taken medication,
Med on: Individuals diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease who have taken medication,
Healthy controls: Healthy individuals with no diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.

The main objective of the project is to examine the differences among these groups using statistical and cognitive analysis methods. Comparing patients before and after medication intake provides insight into the effectiveness of treatment and the progression of the disease. This project serves as a valuable resource for academic research, clinical investigation, and data-driven analysis. For researchers seeking to develop digital biomarkers related to Parkinson’s disease, the dataset offers significant potential to contribute to scientific advancement. Users interested in the project can start by examining the structure of the dataset and using the label definitions as a basis for their own analytical approaches. There are no strict technical prerequisites; anyone with a research interest in Parkinson’s disease can benefit from the dataset. For assistance, users can refer to the project documentation and publicly available resources or engage with academic communities and open data forums for further support. The project is maintained by an interdisciplinary research team. Researchers and contributors interested in neuroscience, Parkinson’s disease, or health technology are welcome to provide feedback, share insights, or collaborate. Rooted in the principles of open data, this project encourages scientific transparency and collaborative exploration.
